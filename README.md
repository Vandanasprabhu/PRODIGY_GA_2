# Image Generation with Pre-trained Models
This repository showcases a text-to-image generation project using Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion model and GPT-2. It involves setting up parameters like device, seed, and model settings in the TTI class to generate images based on text prompts. The project leverages the Stable Diffusion Pipeline for efficient image creation, with key configurations such as the number of steps and guidance scale. A sample test is included to demonstrate generating an image from a prompt like "AI drawing a picture". This project is licensed under the MIT License.
